# 20 Years of Water

## Visualizing water quality testing in the River Basins of Alabama

### Abstract

Alabamas climate and history makes it one of the most ecologically diverse states in the United States. A history of industrial abuse and accidents have led to stricter water monitoring in an attempt to control the human and environmental harm caused by pollutants. This project seeks to analyze the progress that has been made during the past 20 years of water quality testing. For each two year testing period, data from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) is used to visualize the scope of water contamination in each river basin by size, cause, and source.
